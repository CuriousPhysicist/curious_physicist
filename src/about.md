Hi, my name is Andrew Hampson and I'm a physicist by training and a web developer by trade.

I have always had a passion for programming and since the arrival of our daughter I decided to focus on Web Development as a full time career.

I love working in Ruby and using the Ruby-on-Rails framework. I am a mid-level developer and have worked on Rails codebases ranging from e-Commerce sites to cloud based IoT applications.

I enjoy the challenge of knitting together business needs and site features, and Ruby is just a joy of a language for writing code.

When I'm not coding I enjoy playing Tennis and keeping fit. I am a member of the local Crossfit box ([Crossfit Haddington](https://crossfithaddington.com)) and have competed in the [Crossfit Open]() competition.

I also enjoy Mountain Biking, Snowboarding, Wake-boarding and Rock Climbing. I always seek to learn something new and stay curious about everything. I hope you enjoy having a look around the site.
