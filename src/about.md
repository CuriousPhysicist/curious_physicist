Hi, my name is Andrew Hampson and I'm a physicist by training and a web developer by trade.

I have always had a passion for programming and since the arrival of our daughter I decided to focus on Web Development as a full time career.

I love working in Ruby and using the Ruby-on-Rails framework. I am a mid-level developer and have worked on Rails codebases ranging from e-Commerce sites to cloud based IoT applications.

I enjoy the challenge of knitting together business needs and site features, and Ruby is just a joy of a language for writing code.
